Device hierarchy
=================

Service		org.bluez
Interface	org.bluez.Dmtx
Object path	[variable prefix]/{hci0,hci1,...}/dev_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX

Methods		object CreateSymbolicDevice(string xmldata)

			Creates a new object path for a sybolic remote device from xml
			data and without actually connecting to the remote device and retrieving
			any SDP record.

			If the object for the remote device already exists
			this method will fail.

			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.InvalidArguments
					 org.bluez.Error.Failed

            object RemoveSymbolicDevice(string bdaddr)

			This removes the sybolic remote device object at the given
			path if the device is not connected yet.

			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.InvalidArguments
					 org.bluez.Error.Failed

            void Connect()

			Connect to the remote device. If remote device is not paried yet, this
			will also initiate pairing. This makes the device a "real" rather than
			just a symbolic one.

			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.AlreadyConnected
					 org.bluez.Error.ConnectionAttemptFailed

            void Disconnect()

			Disconnect from the remote device and remove it from this from the
			list of symbolic devices.

			To abort a connection attempt in case of errors or
			timeouts in the client it is fine to call this method.

			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.Failed

		dict GetProperties()

			Returns all properties for the interface. See the
			properties section for available properties.

			Possible Errors: org.bluez.Error.InvalidArguments



Signals		SymbolicDeviceCreated(object device)

			Parameter is object path of created device.


            SymbolicDeviceRemoved(object device)

			Parameter is object path of removed device.

            PropertyChanged(string name, variant value)

			This signal indicates a changed value of the given
			property.


Properties boolean Connected [readonly]

			Indicates if the remote device is currently connected.
			From this point, the device should be treated as "real" rather
			than just a symbolic one.
			A PropertyChanged signal indicate changes to this
			status.
